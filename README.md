# Travel Agency Site (CPNT 262 - JavaScript - Final Project)

## Assignment Submission Details 

This is the CPNT 262 (JavaScript) Final Project submission for Alex Madsen. 

## Project Details 

The main goal of this assignment was to develop a website with enchanced interactivity via JavaScript. 

The details of the assignment are given [in the doc provided](./doc/day-9.pdf). 

## Known Issues 

While it does use different files for different functionality, my JavaScript code is not technically modular.

Solving this issue would take more time than I have for this 
project, so I will instead address the portfolio version of this project.
